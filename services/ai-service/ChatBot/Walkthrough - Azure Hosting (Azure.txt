Walkthrough - Azure Hosting (Azure for Students Plan) 🎓 🚀
Since you are using Azure for Students, you have $100 in free credits and access to many free services. The guide below ensures you stay within those free limits while hosting your chatbot.

🏁 The Student-Friendly Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Create a Container Registry (ACR)
Go to the Azure Portal.
Search for Container registries -> Create.
Subscription: Select Azure for Students.
Registry name: Give it a unique name (e.g., studentrestaurantreg).
SKU: Select Basic. (This will use a tiny bit of your $100 credit, but it's very cheap).
Click Review + Create -> Create.
Once created, go to Access keys on the left menu and enable Admin user.
Step 2: Create the Container App (The "No-Error" Way)
Setting up GitHub during creation can sometimes be tricky if the image doesn't exist yet. Let's create the app first, then link GitHub:

Search for Container Apps -> Create.
Subscription: Azure for Students.
Region: East US (recommended).
Container app name: chatbot-service.
Next: Container >: KEEP "Use quickstart image" CHECKED. (This ensures the app compiles and creates without errors).
Click Next: Ingress >.
Ingress: Enabled. Target Port: 80(default for quickstart).
Click Review + Create -> Create.
Step 3: Setup Continuous Deployment (GitHub Link)
Now that the app exists, let's connect your code:

Go to your new Container App resource.
In the left menu, search for Continuous deployment (under the "Settings" or "Deployment" section).
Click Edit.
Source: Select GitHub.
Repository: Select your restaurant project.
Branch: main.
Dockerfile Path: 
services/ai-service/ChatBot/Dockerfile
.
Click Save. Azure will now automatically build and push your real code!
Step 4: Add your Environment Variables
Go to Settings -> Containers -> Edit and deploy.
Click on the container name -> Environment variables.
Add your 
.env
 keys (Azure OpenAI, Mongo URI).
Crucial: Also change the Target Port to 8000 in the Ingress menu on the left, as our FastAPI app uses 8000.
Step 4: Manage Your Credits
Monitor your balance at Azure Education Hub.
Tip: If you are not using the chatbot, you can Suspend the Container App to save credits (though the Free tier is usually enough).
🧪 Verification
Visit the Application Url from the Overview page.
Append /widget to the end.
Test a question to ensure Azure OpenAI and MongoDB are connected.
